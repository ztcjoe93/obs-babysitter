# Obsidian notes babysitter
Python script to automate management of Obsidian notes.  

- Generates a `00.md` in each directory linking to all notes (rewrites on script run)
- Updates each `.md` file to have a `# Quicklink` section that adds all single # headings

TODO:  
- Add proper sections for quicklink
- Add timestamp generation if there are any updates
